# Object Detection using YOLOV7 trained on Synthetic and Real-Life Datasets

This is the reprisatory used for the master's thesis worked by me. The thesis is aiming to compare and analayse the performance between object detection model trained on synthetic and real-life datasets, and then opmtimising the performance of the model.

Inside this reprisatory you will find the main codes for the synthetic data generation in NVIDIA Omniverse, bounding box visualizer for the synthetic images, and bbox format converter.
